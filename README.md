Stuff to Get Noj
================

This was my final project website for 15-437 Web Application Development.  It's
basically a site where you can post things to get me and also get them for me!

Funny story: I built this entire site the day before it was due.  During the
final review of this site, my professor took a quick look at it and pointed out
that I only did the bare minimum in terms of requirements.  After me nodding and
him sighing, he took a lot at the source files.

Prof: "Let's sort these by date...so it seems the oldest file here is just a day old!"

Me: "Um..yeah...I had some computer troubles, so I had to transfer things over
from a backup yesterday..."

Prof: "Roight..."
